# Guessing-T.V.-Show
In this project I have used PyQt4 to design a basic UI for creating an interactive game. In this game names of the T.V. Shows will be jumbled and the player has to guess the correct name of the T.V. show after he submits the score will be displayed.
In this GUI game whenever game starts , the game gives 10 randomly selected TV show names and jumbled , the user has to predict the correct name of the TV show and accordingly how many he guesses correct he gets 1 point. The jumbled word will be different every time and also jumbled in a different way.
Example –  
for Game of Thrones –  
meag of hrotens or  
mega fo rontehs  
This way of jumbling should be different everytime  
Note I've saved almost 30 TV shows name in a list and randomly select 10 of them then jumble those and each word must be jumbled and display the jumbled word to user.
